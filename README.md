MpHx is a new library made with Haxe to allow for easy creation of multiplayer games. It was based off [HxNet](https://github.com/MattTuttle/hxnet), whose code is authored by [Matt Tuttle](https://github.com/MattTuttle). The code is of a very different structure now.

-------------

There are examples in the examples folder, for different libraries. (Basic has no external libraries.)

This library will not be dependent on any 'graphical' library (ie- Haxeflixel, Open FL, luxe). If you want to, you can make a text based multiplayer game.

--------------

Planned features:

-  Automatic management of 'rooms'.
-  Event based multiplayer.
-  Highly abstracted server
-  Easy creation of 'packets' or data objects.
-  Ability to share code between server and client.
