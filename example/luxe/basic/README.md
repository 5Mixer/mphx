# Luxe Example: Basic

This example demonstrates basic client/server interaction with a very simple toy example.

## How to run

### Server
1. Go to the `server` directory
2. Run `haxe build.hxml` (builds a _neko_ server per default)

### Client
1. Install [`flow` and `luxe`](http://luxeengine.com/docs/setup.html)
2. Go to the `client` directory
3. Run `haxelib run flow run web` (or `haxelib run flow run` for creating a native app)
4. Repeat as many times as desired
